# Battery voltage tester

This small device was designed in order to test the voltage of battery, that is used in a van of a friend of mine. He uses it to listen to music, for lights etc. Using this device, he can check if he has to recharge before the battery runs empty. Therefore one only has tu push and hold the button and the voltage will be displayed.


Except for the 3D printed part the project uses a 
[IZOKEE Digital Voltmeter Meter](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07D5BS3T5?ref_=pe_3044161_248799201_302_E_DDE_dt_1) 
and a regular push button that comes with any Arduino starter Kit
