# Battery voltage tester

This small device was designed in order to test the voltage of battery, that is used in a van of a friend of mine. He uses it to listen to music, for lights etc. With this device he knows when he has to recharge before the battery runs empty.

Except for the 3D printed part the project uses a 
[IZOKEE Digital Voltmeter Meter] (https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07D5BS3T5?ref_=pe_3044161_248799201_302_E_DDE_dt_1) 
and a regular push button that comes with any Arduino starter Kit
